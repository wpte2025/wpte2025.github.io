WPTE 2025 (affiliated to FSCD 2025 in Birmingham, UK)

11th International Workshop on Rewriting Techniques for Program
Transformations and Evaluation (July 20th, 2025)

Webpage:     https://wpte2025.github.io/
Submission:  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wpte2025
Deadline:    14th May 2025 (extended)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of WPTE is to bring together researchers working on
program transformations, evaluation, and operationally based
programming language semantics, using rewriting methods, in order to
share the techniques and recent developments and to exchange ideas to
encourage further activation of research in this area.

Topics of Interest
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Correctness of program transformations, optimizations and translations.
* Program transformations for proving termination, confluence, and
  other properties.
* Correctness of evaluation strategies.
* Operational semantics of programs, operationally-based program
  equivalences such as contextual equivalences and bisimulations.
* Cost-models for arguing about the optimizing power of transformations
  and the costs of evaluation.
* Program transformations for verification and theorem proving purposes.
* Translation, simulation, equivalence of programs with different
  formalisms, and evaluation strategies.
* Program transformations for applying rewriting techniques to programs
  in specific programming languages.
* Program transformations for program inversions and program synthesis.
* Program transformation and evaluation for Haskell and rewriting.
* Rewriting-based transformations for bidirectional programming and
  reversible computation.

Submission Guidelines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the paper submission deadline an extended abstract of at most 10
pages is required. The extended abstract may present original work,
but also work in progress. The program committee will select the
presentations for the workshop based on the submissions. All selected
contributions will be included in the informal proceedings distributed
to the workshop participants. One author of each accepted extended
abstract is expected to present it at the workshop in person.

Submissions must be prepared in LaTeX using the EPTCS macro package.

All submissions are to be made via:

  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wpte2025

Post-Proceedings or Journal Special Issue
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the 2020-2023 editions, papers from WPTE were selected for
post-submission and eventual publication in JLAMP special issues.
We will discuss, also based on interest expressed by authors at the
workshop, whether to arrange a special issue or other formal proceedings
for this year's edition.
