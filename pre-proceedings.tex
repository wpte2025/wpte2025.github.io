\section*{Preface}

The 11th International Workshop on Rewriting Techniques for Program Transformations and Evaluation (WPTE~2025) was held on July 20, 2025, in Birmingham, UK, as part of FSCD~2025.
WPTE brings together researchers working on program transformations, evaluation, and operationally based programming language semantics, using rewriting methods.
This volume collects the extended abstracts of the contributions accepted for presentation.
We thank all authors for their submissions and the program committee and reviewers for their feedback.
We hope the contributions will foster further research and collaboration in the rewriting community.
